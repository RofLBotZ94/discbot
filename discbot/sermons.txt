["Loving God, give me eyes to see the people that need your blessing. Please lead me to the folks in our church, our neighborhood, and our work or school that feel forgotten and overlooked. Help me to not only see them, but to include them so they can know the love that you have for them! In Jesus' name I pray. Amen.", 'Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.God is expecting His children to take a compassionate interest in others and at the same time keeping our own lives clean. James mentions caring for the orphans and widows. They were a group of people in his day that were extremely exploited by others, if there was no relative that would care for them they were subject to all sorts of bad situations. Many would die of starvation or be killed by criminals, there was no protection by the law for them. God desires for His people to care for those who are needy and not to turn our backs on them.Then we are told in our verse for today to keep ourselves from being polluted by the world.When we accepted Christ as Savior, there was a change that took place in our hearts.', '12 When he opened the sixth seal, I looked, and behold, there was a great earthquake, and the sun became black as sackcloth, the full moon became like blood.', '13 and the stars of the sky fell to the earth as the fig tree sheds its winter fruit when shaken by a gale.', '14 The sky vanished like a scroll that is being rolled up, and every mountain and island was removed from its place.', '15 Then the kings of the earth and the great ones and the generals and the rich and the powerful, and everyone, slave[d] and free, hid themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains', '16 calling to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us and hide us from the face of him who is seated on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb', '17 for the great day of their wrath has come, and who can stand?']
